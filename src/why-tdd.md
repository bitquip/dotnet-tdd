# Why TDD?

Imagine building a complex structure without a blueprint. The result might be unstable and error-prone. Similarly, in software development, writing code without a clear plan can lead to unforeseen bugs and difficulties.

This is where Test-Driven Development comes into play. TDD is like having a blueprint for your code.

The TDD process involves three fundamental steps:

1. **Write a failing test**

2. **Write the minimum code to make it pass**

3. **Refactor to improve the code without changing its behavior**

**_Let's break down these steps further:_**

### 1. Red: Write a Failing Test

Consider you're an engineer developing plans for an advanced airliner.

Before construction begins, meticulous planning is essential to ensure the final aircraft's excellence. This mirrors the essence of Test-Driven Development (TDD).

The process starts by drafting a test that precisely outlines the desired behavior. Initially, the test purposefully fails since the corresponding code hasn't been generated.

Just as a well-crafted blueprint is vital before building an airliner, the "red" phase highlights the significance of progressing purposefully towards a clear objective.

### 2. Green: Write the Minimum Code

Once your failing test is in place, it's time to write the minimum code necessary to make the test pass.

This step corresponds to assembling the key structural elements of the airliner according to the blueprint.

In TDD, the code is methodically composed to satisfy the test's conditions.

Although not exhaustive, the "green" phase effectively demonstrates the code's ability to fulfill the intended task.

### 3. Refactor: Improve Without Changing Behavior

With the airliner's foundational structure in place, refinement follows. In TDD, this entails improving the code's efficiency without changing its core behaviorâ€”akin to optimizing the airliner's design to enhance performance without compromising its original intent.

Through streamlining, optimization, and thoughtful adjustments, the "refactor" phase guarantees code reliability while promoting better organization.
