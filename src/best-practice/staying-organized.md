# Staying Organized

## Organizing Tests with Test Suites

As our Test-Driven Development (TDD) project grows, it becomes important to keep our tests organized for better maintainability. Test suites allow us to group related tests together and manage our tests more effectively.

### Introducing Test Suites

A test suite is a collection of related test cases that focus on specific functionalities or components. By organizing tests into suites, we can easily identify and run tests associated with specific parts of our application.

#### Step 18: Organizing Tests into Suites

1. In the `GearTests.cs` file located in the `Tests` folder of your test project, let's organize our tests into suites using the `TestClass` attribute:

```csharp
using Xunit;

// ...

public class GearTests
{
    // Test suite for Gear class properties
    [Trait("Category", "Properties")]
    public class PropertiesTests
    {
        // ... Existing property tests here ...
    }

    // Test suite for Gear class methods
    [Trait("Category", "Methods")]
    public class MethodsTests
    {
        // ... Existing method tests here ...
    }

    // Test suite for Gear class with mocked dependencies
    [Trait("Category", "MockedDependencies")]
    public class MockedDependencyTests
    {
        // ... Existing tests with mocks here ...
    }

    // Parameterized test suite for gear calculations
    [Trait("Category", "Calculations")]
    public class CalculationsTests
    {
        // ... Existing parameterized tests here ...
    }
}
```

In this example, we're using nested classes to create test suites based on different categories such as properties, methods, mocked dependencies, and calculations. The `Trait` attribute helps categorize the tests for better organization.

### Managing Complexity with Test Suites

As your codebase expands, maintaining a well-organized suite of tests becomes essential. By grouping tests into logical categories, you can manage complexity and locate specific tests more efficiently.

Congratulations! You've learned how to organize your tests into suites, enhancing the maintainability and manageability of your testing efforts. By categorizing your tests effectively, you're simplifying the process of navigating and running your tests.
