# Test Coverage

## Ensuring Code Quality with Test Coverage

As we advance in our Test-Driven Development (TDD) journey, it's crucial to emphasize the concept of test coverage. Test coverage measures the proportion of your codebase that is tested by your unit tests. High test coverage is a sign of a well-tested and reliable application.

### Understanding Test Coverage

Test coverage provides insights into which parts of your code are exercised by your tests and which parts are not. High test coverage ensures that potential bugs and issues are identified early, leading to more robust and stable software.

#### Step 12: Measuring Test Coverage

1. In the terminal or command prompt, navigate to the root directory of your project.

2. Run the tests with coverage using the following command:

```bash
dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"
```

This command runs your tests and collects code coverage information.

3. After the tests are executed, you will find a coverage report. Open the coverage report in your web browser to visualize the coverage details.

### Interpreting the Coverage Report

The coverage report provides insights into which parts of your code are covered by tests. Covered lines are indicated in green, while lines that are not covered are highlighted in red.

#### Step 13: Interpreting the Coverage Report

1. Analyze the coverage report to identify areas of your code that may need additional testing. Focus on achieving high coverage for critical and complex code sections.

2. Iterate by writing more tests to cover untested portions of your code and repeating the process to ensure comprehensive coverage.

### Embracing Test-Driven Development and Test Coverage

**Congratulations!** 

By combining TDD with a focus on high test coverage, you're creating a powerful approach to developing reliable software. TDD guides you in creating functional code, while test coverage ensures that your entire codebase is well-tested.

You've gained insights into the importance of test coverage and how it contributes to the quality and reliability of your application. As you continue your journey in TDD and .NET development, remember to strive for comprehensive coverage while writing tests for new features and enhancements.

Stay engaged as we explore advanced TDD concepts and further enrich our knowledge of .NET development!
